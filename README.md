Algorithms
==========
Have you ever been in the middle of USACO, ICPC, TopCoder competition and thought to yourself, "God I wish I had 
implemented this earlier!" or "Man I'm really hungry right now." Well me too (more the second than the first). 
Introducing Algorithms! a grab bag collection of java algorithms and data structures that will reduce your
time needlessly implementing code.

Disclaimer

All jokes aside, this package is not meant to be used during competitions that disallow the use of previously written 
code. Please be fair and follow the rules. Also sometimes I test my code with a strong emphasis on *sometimes*. If 
anything is broken, or there are better methods of implementing certain functionalities please contact me and let me 
know!
